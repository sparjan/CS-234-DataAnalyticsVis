3914	MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION.EMERY EXHIBIT No. 39-Ca1:c1t BooK.-  Mr. McCARTER. Letter No. 2757-2760, it apparently being a letter from Mulhall to Schwedtman, contains the following statement:  I had a telegram from Mr. Emery on Friday night, calling me to New York on Satur- day morning.Senator REED. What is the date of that letter 1Mr. McC'ARTER. It  is dated June 2, 1909.	I continue reading:  We had a conference in relation to the Washington situation, and he stated what he wished me to do and ve me to undenitand plainly what he wiehee done while he ie absent. He has put 1t up to me to fix the Judiciary Committee and the Labor Com­ mittee while he 1e away, and I feel certain I can have thie done, as we have been working upon this for eome time. It looks as though we would meet with success all along the line.What have you to say in regard to that statement 1Senator  R•EED.  Now, I  do submit, if  the  committee    Iee.se-   I havemade  the objection several  times and our friend here, 1know, under­ stands-that the proper way to examine the witness is to ask him whether or not certain things took place, and not to read somebodyelse's testimony or statement and ask the witness to comment upon it, or to ask him whether it is true or false.  Mr. McCARTER. I will endeavor to accommodate myself, Senator Reed,  to your desire.	I thou ht it was the quickest way to do it.Senator REED. It is the quickest way, of course.
MAINTENANCE   OF  A  LOBBY   TO INFLUENCE  LEGISLATION.	8915  Senator CUMMINS. In view of the way in which our witnesses have been examined here, it seems to me that the question is a proper one. He is not referring to any testimony.llr. McCARTER. No, this is a letter.  Senator REED. He is asking the witness now purely for comment upon a letter. He says "What have you to say in regard to that statement" 1Senator ClrnMINS. He of course means to call out his recollectionin regard to that statement.  Senator REED.  I should not think that it would  necessarily eall­ I do not want to be captious about it, but I submit to  the  com­ mittee  that  where  the  witness  is an attorney,  to  begin with 1  andhe  has  been  put   upon  the  stand  here  in  the  attitude  of  a  witnessfor what they are pleased to term "the defense," my  idea  of  the weight· which must be given to his testimony would be considerably affected by the  question  whether  it  is given  in one way or  whether it i<i given in another wav.The CHAIRMAN. I think he may answer the question. Senator CUMMINS. Yes.  The CHAIRMAN. Go ahead, :Mr. McCarter, and frame the question. Mr.  McCARTER.  This  letter  says,  "He"   (meaning Emery)   "has put it up to me" (Mulhall) "to  fix  the  Judiciary Committee  and  the Labor Committ  e  while  he"   (Emery)  "is  away."	Had you done anysuch thing as that with Mr. Mulhall 1Mr. EMERY. Why, no, sir.Senator NELSON. Speak a little louder. Mr. EMERY. No, sir.  Mr. McCARTER. What, if anything, did you say or do with Mr. Mulhall with regard to any activity he was to display touching the formation or the attitude of the Judiciary Committee and the Labor Committee, while you were away at this time, which was June 2, 19091 Senator REED. Will you please give me the number of that letteragain¥	I have fo1otten it.Mr. McCARTER.	tis 2757-2760.  Mr. EMERY. I do not reco_llect distinctly the details of the conver­ sation which is alluded to in that letter, which doubtless took  place;  but I am positive that no conversation _passed between us with ref­ erence to any such statement as that. I was going away  to  be gone some time, and at most could  have asked Col. Mulhall  to inform  me as to any appointments made on this committee during my absence.Senator REED. Oh, I object.The CHAIRMAN. Just state the facts.Mr. EMERY. That is my best recollection, Senator.  The CHAIRMAN. You say at most you could have done so and so. State the facts.  Mr. EMERY. I say I could not undertake  to relate the conversation. That I do  not  undertake  to do;  but  my best  recollection  is that, so far as relates to that subject, I requested  him  to  keep  me  informed as  to any_ change in the personnel of these committees durin my absence.  Mr. McCARTER. Did you, either  at  that or at  any otner  time,  put it up to Mr. Mulhall to fix either the Judiciary Committee or the Committee on Labor 1Mr. EiomY. I did not.
3916	MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION,  Mr. McCARTER. I want to return for a moment to the McMichael matter, which I overlooked, and of which ou reminded me.Did you ever make a payment to Mulhall for McMichael 1Mr. EMERY. Yes.Mr. McCARTER. When, and under what circumstances 1  Mr. EMERY. While Mr. Mcl\iichael was sending to my office with the documents and bills I referred to, Col. Mulhall, who had made the arrangement, suggested that he be paid, I think it was $15 a month.Senator REED. $151  Mr. EMERY. I think so, yes, sir; and that money was paid to Col. Mulhall, and I suppose he gave it to Mr. McMichael.  It  may have  been as much, during some months of the time he served, as $20. It never exceeded that, that is positive; and the relation terminated entirely in 1910, when I went to Europe.  Senator NELSON. When you left for Europe, or when you came back1Mr. EMERY. When I left, Senator.  Mr. McCARTER. There has been some testimony here with regard to the use of a secret room in the basement of this building, and your assent to that proposition. Tell us all you know about that.  Mr. EMERY. Col. Mulhall at various times suggested the establish­ ment of what he called a bureau of information, from which con­ gressional documents, bearing upon the various subjects, or argu­ ments which had  been  had  before  various committees  here, should be distributed.  Sometime  in  l!H1  he  made  the  definite suggestion to me that the secretary of some congressional friend had offered to permit him to use a room here in the Capitol building, for the purpose of accumulating documents, and putting them  in  there  ana  sending  them out under frank to the members of the association and of other organizations which would be interested in such distribution,  and  I told the Colonel at the time that it was an utterly impossible proposal.Senator NELSON. What did you say1  Mr. EMERY. That it was an utterly impossible proposal; that  the use even under such circumstances of any room in the Capitol would invite a very J>roper criticism, and that I under no  circumstances would  agree to  have any further discussion of it.	.Later than that, when I was in New York, Mr. Bird told me thattheColonel had made the same proposition to h!fil, an4 he wan ed t-0 know what I thought of such a thmg, and I said  to hrm  that it  was·  too absurd to discuss; that it would justly invite criticism, and that it must not  be considered,  and  told him what I  bad said  to the Colonel. I  used probably stronger language  than I  am using now.	That is the last I  lieard of the  matter.	Mr. Bird told me he intended to immedi­ ately write to the Colonel and condemn the matter, just as he had already condemned it in conversation with him.Senator REED.  Mr. Chairman,  may I interrupt¥	I  want  to makean inquiry of the committee. We have heretofore agreed on adjourn­ ing at 12 o'clock. We changed the time of adjournment this morning to 11 o'clock because of the Senate convening at that hour, and I want to know if it is proper for us to fo on while the Senate is in session, or whether we should stop now. know Senator Cummins particularly wants to be at the tariff debate, and there is very good reason why  he should have that desire. I was going to make this suggestion to the committee, whether it is not possible for us to either take up these
MAINTENANCE  OF A  LOBBY  TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION.	3917matters at night sessions and get through with them,  or  to  try  and have the members arrange very soon for a day  when  we can start  in  in the morning and run through, until we get  through  with  Mr. Emery's testimony, because  the  matter  is  dragging-of  itself;  I  am not criticizing anybody.Mr. McCARTER. No.  Senator REED. And a.lso because I myself am very anxious, and I think all the members are anxious, to hear the tariff discussions. They are getting pretty warm and interesting, and are on important matters. I wanted to see  just  what  the  committee  thought  about it, and therefore I thought I would stop here for that suggestion.  Senator CU?tlMINS. Mr. Chairman, I must be in the Senate this morning, but I do not think I will be engafed there more than a few minutes, for I do not now intend to do what had expected to do at  this time.  However,  I  feel  that  I  would  like  to  be  present  at  least  most of  the  time  during  the   tariff   debate.   I  am   perfectly   willing  that the examination of  Mr. Emery shall go on in  my  absence.  I  can  read the record.  Senator REED. Mr. McCarter, h11ve you an idea about how long it will take you to conclude 1  Mr. McCARTER. I should think in half an hour I should be through with Mr. Em·ery _on what I call our direct examination,  unless there is some other interruption.Senator REED. Yes.  Mr. McCARTER. I have gotten down now to a few srecific questions that I wanted to ask him concerning the business.  do not think it will take more than half or three-quarters of an hour, Senator Reed.Senator REED. Suppose we go on until 12 o'clock to-day1  Senator NELSON. And let us not interrupt any more than is nec­ essary.The CHAIRMAN.

Can you not avoid that kind of examination 1  The CHAIRMAN. You might refresh his memory and then ask the question.Senator  REEU.  That might lead·us  a  long ways off.

MAINTENANCE  OF  A  LOBBY  TO  INFLUENCE  LEGISLATION.	8919  Mr. McCARTER. At rage 2784 I read an extract from letter 1610- 1612, received by Mr. Mulhall from Mr. Schwedtman. The extract t-0 which I desire to call the witness's attention reads as follows:  Mr. Yan Cleave ha. had  a  number of  conferences  with  Mr.  Bird,  and  he has spoken to  him  about  your  work,  and  it  is  understood  that  your  relationship  with  the  St. Louis office is exactly the same as it has been in the past, • amely, that  you  are  under direct instructions from the St. Louis  office.  This,  however,  does  not  le886n  the necessity of working in absolute hannony with the New York office and in the closest po&1ible touch with Ir. Bird, the busine88 manager. While working under direct IJll!f.ructions from St. Louis, your own  good  sense.tells  you  that  when  in  the  New York office it is necessary to comply with the rules and  regulatione  under  which  that office is working.	·  Directing your attention to that paragraph,  I  ask  you whether  or not it is true that during the period when you and Mr. Mulhall were collaborating in Washington, as you have described, he was under directions of the St. Louis office,  and  later  under directions of the New York office, and not under your immediate controlMr. EMERY. May I ask the date of that letter 1  I  did not catch it. Mr. McCARTER.  It  does not  give the date here	It is letter 1610-1612.	I will ask the clerk to give us the dateMr. EMERY. Well, I can say generally, Mr. Mccarter--The CLERK OF THE COMMITTEE. The letter is dated June 2, 1908.Mr. McCARTER. You may go on, Mr. Emery.  Mr.  ElIERY.  I  can  say  generally  with  respect  to  the  control  of Mr. Mulhall's actions from the time I came to  Washington  in 1908, that while he was here in Washington he gave me any assistance he could on the lines that I have described; but he was very frequently called away, or.went away, and I understood he did so under directions from St. Louis; and when he returned he was subject to such instruc­ tions or orders as he had from there. He gave me generally the same assistance as I have described, until in 1910 he was specifically placed under }fr. Bird's directions and orders, and obeyed such orders as he received from  there.  "When  he came to Washington  and  came here to assist me in any way, he came here pursuant to a request by me to Mr. Bird, or an order from Mr. Bird.Mr. McCARTER. On page 2791 of the record appears a letter, No.1647, which appears to be written to James A. Emery by Mr. Mulhall.I C'all attention to the third paragraph.· Mr. EMERY. Will you give me the date of thatletted  Mr. McCARTER. I have not the date here. I will ask the clerk  to  give the date.The CLERK OF THE COMMITTEE. The letter is dated June 23, 1908. Mr. McCARTER. The third paragraph of  that  letter,  as  quoted  in the record, reads:  From the information I could get from those gentlemen it  appears  to me  that  we have a good fighting chance to win this district, providing that you can do as you told Judge Jenkins you would do, to aid him by raising some funds in the East, so he could put the necessary workers going here as soon as possible to do so. The judge remem­ bered the promise you made him in Washington and is very anxiou.e to hear from you at the earliest moment.With reference to that, do you remember the Jenkins campaign of19081Mr. EKEBY. Yes, sir.
3920	MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION,  Mr. McCARTER. Do you remember an interview between you and Judge Jenkins, in Washington or elsewhere, with reference to that campaign 1  Mr. EMERY. I had a talk with Judge Jenkins in the winter of 1908, the only conversation I remember having had with him. I  did  not know Judge Jenkins except slightly. I had appeared before his committee and discussed matters there, but I do not recall having but one conversation with him personally.Mr. McCARTER. And that was later than this letter, apparentlv.  Mr. EMERY. I mean the winter of 1907-8,  the  spring  of 1908, I had  a  conversntion with him.	I can not say certamly whether Mr. Mulhall was present or not, but I remember meeting Judge Jenkins in his committee room in the course of an inguiry I was ma	as to some hearings, and I sat  down and talked  to him for maybe 10 mmutes.	In that conversation he discussed his coming campaign.	He spoke of the fact that he was going to have a very stiff fight, that the labor organiza­ tions were criticizing him very shal"J)ly for the position he had taken on injunction legislation, and expressecl very strongly, as I remember, his determination to never change his views on the subject, because they had been bis views all his life as a lawyer.			I reca11 saying to him very distinctly that I thought every business man in the countrv was  a debtor to him for the position which he had so boldly taken; and the views which he had so freely expressed.	That was about the extent of the  conversation.		There was nothing  more  than  that.  I  think  I was introduced to Mr. Jenkins that time  by  his brother-a younger man, a Mr. Jenkins, who was either secretary to J:udge Jenkins, or connected with the committee in some way, I do not remember precisely  what.	That is the only conversation  I  ever had  with Judge Jenkins, other than the discussion that  might have occurred with  him in the  course of an  argument.		That is the only conversa­ tion I ever had with him prior to the campaign of 1908 in his district.  Mr. McCARTER. Did you at that time or any other time agree with him, or say to him, that you would raise some funds in the East¥Mr. EMERY. No, sir; I did not.  Senator REED. You got this letter  from  Mr.  Mulhall,  did  you not1Mr. EMERY.  I do not know.	If _Y.OU will let me see that letter, per­haps I can tell.	I  am not sure.	lAfter examining letter:] Yes, sir; unaoubtedly I received that letter.  Senator REED. Did you ever write a letter repudiating  any  part of it¥Mr. EMERY. No; I do not think I wrote the Colonel on the sub­ject at all.  Senator REED. On the contrary, you and your association con­ tinued to make efforts for Judge Jenkins in  that  campaign,  as  is shown by numerous letters¥Mr. EMERY.  I  denv  that  I made any efforts.  Senator REED. I am  not  talking  about  you  personally;  but  did no! _your association make efforts in his behalf¥Mr. EMERY.  I think they did.	I have noticed letters to that effect.  Senator REED. And not only Mr. Mulhall wrote you, but other officers of the association wrote you, about this whole matter¥Mr. EMERY. I think so.
MAINTENANCE   OF  A  LOBBY  TO INFLUENCE  LEGISLATION.	3921  Senator REED. And you never repudiated it, or never wrote back and said he was writing a lot of stuff that there was no truth in 1Mr. EMERY. Mr. Mulhall called on me shortly after that,-:­ Senator REED. You did not repudiate it in person 1Mr. EMERY. I did.Senator REED. You remember that1Mr. EMERY. Yes.Senator REED. But you did not write him about it 1  Mr. EMERY. He called on me shortly after that, I do not remember when.Senator REED. Called on you for money, did he not 1l\lr. EMERY. Yes.  Senator REED. And the  association  went  right  on  raising  money for him 1  Mr. EMERY. I was not connected, except remotely, with the National Association of Manufacturers.	I was secretary of the Citizens' Indus­ trial Association.	He called on me in New York on the subject of raising money, I remember very distinctly.	He wanted Mr. Post who was the president of the Citizens' Industrial Association, and was reputed to be and was in fact a wealthy man, to make a con­ tribution--  Senator REED. You know there has been produced correspondence between Mr. Mulhall and Mr. Post showing that  Mr. Post was  trying to raise money 1  llr. EMERY. No, I do not think there has been any such corre­ spondence.  Senator REED. There is correspondence in here, is there not, which shows that Mr. Post was trying to help raise that money1  Mr. EMERY. No. I think what you have in mind is correspondence with me in which Mr. Mulhall urged me to get Mr. Post to make some contr;bution.Sena.tor REED. Is there not such correspondence1  Ir. EMERY.  I  think  that is in regard  to another matter.	I think it is doubtless the Watson campaign you have in mind.Senator  REED. Very well.	The letters will show.  Mr. EMERY.  The  letters  will  show;  but   that   is   my   recollection. I will only say in connection with it that I told the Colonel it was impossible to do anything of the kind; that Mr. Post would not con­ tribute, and that I could not help him.  Sena.tor REED. That you could not help him, although in this conver­ sation with Judge Jenkms, when he told you he was going to have a hard fli:!ht, that the labor unions were going to fi ht him, you told him that aif the manufacturers of the country were mdebted to him; and did you say anything then a.bout hel_ping him1  Mr. EMERY. Nothing beyond what I have told you, that I thought they were indebted to him and I felt sure that if anyone passed the hat in that matter, in view of the position of Judge Jenkins the manu­ facturers all over the country would contribute. But they did not.Senator REED. If you said that--  Mr. EMERY.  I did not say that  to Judge Jenkins.	I do not want to be misunderstood.Senator REED. Did you not say a little while ago that you did havea conversation with Judge Jenkins1Mr. EMERY. Yes sir.
8922	MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION,  Senator REED. And that in that conversation he told 7ou he was going to be fought by the labor organizations on account o his injunc­ tion attitude1Mr. EMERY. Yes sir.  Sena.tor REED. Did you not say that in that conversation you said to him in substance-I can not quote the exact language-that you thought all the manufacturers of the country were indebted to him 1Mr. EMERY. Yes sir.  Senator REED Did lou not in  that  conversation  also say  to  him that  you would  be gla  to assist  him in any way you could, or  words to that effect 1Mr. EMERY. I think I did.  Senator REED. Then do you think that it was at all inconsistent for Mr. Mulhall to write this. I will have to read the text to get the sentence out:  From the infonnation I could get from those gentlemen it appeal'!! to  me that  we have got a good fighting chance to win in this district,  providing  that  you can do as  you told Judge Jenkins you  would  do, to aid  him  by raising some funds in  the  East, flO he could put the necel-lSIU')' workers going here a. flOOn as po!!Sible to do so. The judge reml'mbered the promise you made him in Washington  and  is very anxious to hear from you at the earliest moment.  Do you not think that language  is  entirely  consistent  with  what you now say took place¥  Mr. EMERY. It might be the interpretation of an opinion  on  my part turned into a p omi e. I made  no  P.romise;  I  could  not  do  it; and there was notbmg m the conversat10n on the part· of Judge  Jenkins that indicated a hope of financial assistance.  Senator REED. When you said to him that the manufacturers were indebted to him, you thought they would help him¥Mr. EMERY. Yes.  Senator REED. The only way the manufacturers all over the coun­ try could help him would be, not ·by voting for him, because they did not live in his district, but by rendering financial help W The only other way to help him was by cold, hard cash;  that is about all that is left, is it not 1Mr. EMERY. Yes; I realize your interpretation of it.  Senator REED. Particularly in view of the fact that there were no manufacturers in his district to speak of.Mr. EMERY. But there were many manufacturers in Wisconsin. Senator REED. But in Judge Jenkins's district¥  Mr. E:r.1ERY. I heard that statement here.  I  was not familiar with his district.  :Mr. McCARTER. I now call your attention to page 2940 of the record, where there is a quotation from a letter from Mulhall to Schwedtman.Senator REED. What is the number of the letter1Mr. McCARTER. 2171-2188.	In this letter Mulhall says:  I had a long interview with Mr. Emery on Monday morning and fully went over the situation with him and went to Paterson on Monday night ana had a second interview with  him on  Tuesday  noon.   Mr.  Emery  has chan_ged  his  mind  about  that district. I gave him a large hst of manufacturel'I! in that district, and he started  to working among them for the couple of  days that I will be West and  will do all he can  to help  me out.
MAINTENANCE   OF  A  LOBBY  TO INFLUENCE  LEGISLATION.	8923Mr. EMERY. What is the date of that 1  Mr. McCARTER. October 28; 1908. Did you have such an inter­ view with Mr. Mulhall, and did you in fact start the work in the Hughes district, in Paterson, in that campaign 1  Mr. EMERY. I can not  say  a.s to having  had  an  interview  with him at that d11,te, but the arrangement there  discussed  certainly  was not made,  nor  did  I  do  any  work  of  the  kind  described.  I  never  went into anybody's district.  Senator REED. You mean you never literally and personally went int-0 it. Do you mean  to say  that you did  not  do anything  to affect thf' result in that district 1Mr. EMERY. At that time1Senator REED. Yes.  Mr. EMERY. I  could  not  say off hand, Sena.tor.	I might have written letters into the district, or I might have sent literature there. Senator REED. That is evidently what this means, instead of your literallv going in and going around  to see voters.	I do not see thatthere would be much good in that. Mr. McCARTER.

I  can not say whether the conversation took place, but I did not  do  the things described there, nor did I do them at any other time.Senator WALSH. The qualification came from]ourself, Mr. Emery. Mr. EMERY.  That is possible, Sena.tor.	I  ha	no mental reserva­tion about it.  Senator REED. Let me ask, were you at this time,  October  28,  1908, located in Washington or in New York1Mr. EMERY. In New York.Senator REED. You were just across the river from New Jersey. Mr. EMERY. I was just gomg to Washington.  Senator REED. Many of the manufacturers in New Jersey  had offices in Ne.v York City.Mr. EMERY. Why, I suppose so.  Senator REED. A number of them were members of the organiza­ tion of which you were then  the secretary,  namely,  the---what  was the name of that association 1Mr. EMERY. The Citizens' Industrial Association of America.  Senator REED. Are vou prepared to say that in that  campaign you did not int{lrcede, 0 by letter or in person, or both, with various manufacturers who were living in New Jersey, with regard to the Hughes campaign¥  Mr. EMERY. I do not think I engaged in any activity, Senator, beyond recommending the distribution in l\fr. Hughes's district of an

There were a number of copies of that argument--Senator REED. How many1  Mr. EMERY. I say there were a number of copies of that argument printed-I do not  know how many; maybe four or five thousand-and I recommended their distribution in }us district.  Senator REED. That was an argument in favor of exempting labor organizations from the pains, penalties and inhibitions of the Sherman Act1Mr. EMERY. From the Sherman Act.Senator REED. Then, of course, it was a proposition which would befavorably received b;y- organized labod Mr. EMERY. Yes, mdeed.  Sena.tor REED. Therefore you did not circulate those four or five thousand copies of Mr.Hughes's address among the members of or­ ganized labor, because that would have helped Hughes instead of hurting_ him 1  Mr.  EMERY. Oh, no.	I say I suggested its distribution among the business men in his district.  Senator REED. You circulated it primarily among the manufac­ turers, did you not 1  Mr. EMERY.   I did  not circulate it.	It was turned over to the New York office for circulation.Senator REED. I know you di<l not do the manual work.  Mr. EMERY.

And your suggestion, in the way you made it, wassufficient to cause the work to be done1Mr. EMERY. Why, yes; I think it was done.  Senator REED. Inaddition to the mere sending out to these gentle­ men of the naked remarks of Mr. Hughes, did /ou not send some letter or communication, pointing the moral an adorning the tale, if you please, so that these gentlemen would understand why you sent them Mr. Hughes's remarks 1Mr. EMERY. I do not think I did, Senator.  Senator REED. You know, do you not, that there wtlre circulars gotten out and sent to manufacturers, attacking Hughes because of his speech that he had made, and because of his labor attitude1 You know that1  :Mr. EllERY. I think there were, Senator. I do not want you to misunderstand me. If I had done it I would not hesitate to say so, because I would  not  hesitate to write a circular on that subject; but I have no recollection of having done so in that instance.Senator REED. They were sent out1:Mr. EMERY. I think so.  Senator REED. I do not say  whether  you  \\Tote  it  or  not, and I do not care whether vou wrote it or not, or. whether you had one of your hired men write [t, or whether one of the other members of the association wrote it; you were fully in accord with that kind of cam­ paign, and you think you did go far enough at least to suggest sending the speech 1Mr. EMERY. Oh, yes, I think so.
MAINTE  ANCE   OF  A   LOBBY   TO INFLUENCE   LEGISLATION.	392.5  Senator REED. So as a matter of fact, now, so far as you were active at all in the Hughes matter, you were active against Mr. Hughes1Mr. EMERY. Yes.  Senator REED. And it was of sufficient importance in that cam­ paign to beat lfr. Hughes, so th t thematter m some way, by some­ bodv, was drawn to your attention--Mr. EMERY.

I was present--  Senator REED. Then what is really wrong with this statement in the letter which says:I had a long interview with Mr. Emery on Monday moming-  You say you do not remember whether  you  hnd  that or  not,  but you might have had it.Ir. EMERY. Yes.Senator REED. I continue:and fully went over the irituation with him and went to Paterson on Monday night and had a l!econd interview with him on Tuesday noon.Of course from New York over to Paterson was just a matter of a.few minutes, I suppose.Mr. EMERY. Yes.Mr. McCARTER. 1\.buut an hour.Senator  REED.  It is  just  a short run.	It is accessible.	He says:Mr. Emery haa changed his mind about that district.From that I take it that you had thought there was no use in tryingtu beat Hughes.}Ir. EMERY. I do not recollect precisely what it was. Senator REED. He continues:I gave him a large list of manufacturers in that district-  You did have this speech sent out to some one, and you did ha.ve it sent to the manufacturers. Of course it is wholly unimportant whether you got that list yourself, or Mulhall handed it to you; but asa. matter of fact you are not prepared to say that Mulhall did not give you a list of manufacturers 1  Mr. E11ERY. Oh, no; only handing me a list of manufacturers, con­ sidering the facilities of our office, evidently was carrying coals to New­ castle.  Senator REED. Except that he might have looked up a list of manufacturers in that special district. You might not have known  the limits of the congressional district..Mr. EMERY. Oh, no, that is quite true.  Senator REED. And he miglit also have been able to tell ;ou whether some of  these  men were specially  influential, or woul	be likely  to be active.	That kind of information might not have been coals t-0 Newcastle, but might have been what Newcastle wanted at that time.

Why did you say it was likely that these addresses of }fr. Hughes were sent out under Mr. Littlefield's frank  Mr. EMERY. Because of the fa.ct that the argument was  made  before the Judiciary Committee, and this was a report of that argu­ ment. We would ask for an order from the chairman of the sub­ committee or of the full committee-for permission-to print  the speech and distribute it.Senator REED. Forpermission to print it 1  Mr. EMERY. Yes. There is no other way that I know of by which you can have the Government Printing Office print any speech before Congress or before any committee, except to get an order from one of the SenatoTI1 or :Members of the House, and pay for the printing.  Senator REED. You would get an order and have it printed m the Government Printing Officc1 Of course if the speech was taken down and transcribed, you could have had it printed at a private  printing office without  anybody's permission 1	·)Ir. EMERY. Yes. Senator REED. And you could then have sent it out and paid the postage upon it. and.sent it wherever you pleasPd 1Mr. EMERY. Certamly.  Senator REED. So that when  you got  an order from  a Congressman t-0 have it _printed in the Government Printing Office, you did it so that it could be sent out under a frank 1)fr. EMERY. Yes.Senator REED. And in this instance you think it was probably fr.Littlefield's frank 1  }fr. EMERY. Yes, I should assume that,just from the circumstances of the discussion. I  may  not  be stating  it  accurately,  but that is my assumption, because it was the practice--  Senator REED. You did not have to get  permission  from  the chairman of the committee in order to get a public proceeding of that kind printed at the Government Printing Office.

This  letter  is  dated  December  10, 1908.  In  this letter I find the following:  We have secured in the person of George R. Malby, a  Representative from  New York, a man who will fill the  bill entirely in  Judge  Jenkins's  place when he  finishes his term as chairman of the Judiciarv Committee. We are working to make Mr. Malby chairman of that committee,  and  thishas  been  entirely satisfactory  to Mr. Emery, and I think it is a splendid move.On the next page, page 2950 of the printed record, is the following:Senator REED. \\'hat committee was that?Mr. MULHALL. The Committee on the Judiciary.Senator REED. Why were you trying to make up that committee?Mr. MULHALL. They were trying to get Mr. Malby on that committee. I guees thatui what it means.Senator REED. Whv did you want him on that committee?Mr. MULHALL. To take the place of Judge Jenkins.Senator REED.

Because Mr. Emery positively stated that he had interviewed Mr. Malby on several occaeioll.8, and that he thought he would take Judge Jenkins's place, and along the same lines, and if appointed on the committee, he would be beneficial to the manufacturers while in that position.  Do you remember the fa.ct of the candidacy of Mr. Malby for the position formerly occupied by Judge Jenkins1Mr. EMERY.

Will you pardon me a moment 1 If I have  not  made myself cl£>ar to  the Senator,  I  desire, in  justice  to myself,  to say  that so far as I was concerned I knew of no movo to make  l\Ir.  l\Ialbv chairman of the committee,  and  if  such  a  movti  was  in  existence  ii1 the mind  of  Mr. Mulhall  I  had  no knowledge of  it.

'Why, if Mr. Malby had been chairman of the committee, I certainly would not have objected to it. But I want it distinctly understood that we made no such effort to make him chaim1an.  Senator WALSH. You say you ma.de no effort; but you do not mean to say the Manufacturers' Association ma.de no effort 1  Mr. EMERY. So far as I know, the Manufacturers' Association ma.de no effort.  Senator WALSH. While you did not know it, Mr. Mulhall evidently knew it when he wrote th1S letter.Mr. McCARTER. Is not that a psychological question 1  Sena.tor WALSH. No, it is not a. psychological _question. The im­ portance of the matter consisted, not in whether Mr. Emery knew  it,  but in whether the association knew it.Mr. McCARTER. We a.re examining Mr. Emery now.  The CHAIRMAN. I think it is a little out of order, because it is cross- exa.mina.tion.Sena.tor REED. I will make it in order.You and Mr. Schwedtma.n were on good termsWMr. EMERY. Certainly.Senator REED. You had daily communications with himMr.  EMERY. Oh, no--	.Sena.tor REED. Well, you had frequent communications, and thereare in the files hundreds of letters between you and Mr. Schwedtma.n 1Mr. EMERY. Yes, sir.  Sena.tor REED. You say that you did not know of this.  Do you  mean to say that Mr. :Mulhall was trying to conceal it from  you, or that you simply_ do not recollect it 1  Mr. EMERY. No; there is no question of recollection. I would distinctly know-that is, I would know certainly-if I participated in such a movement; and I ought to know if the association was par­ ticipating in such a movement.Senator REED. But Mr. Mulhall did write the a8sociation about it YMr. EMERY. It is very evident.

Very truly yours,J. A. E./M. W.
JAM EB A. EMERY,Secret.ary.
  P. S.-1 enclose a copy of a letter written by Mr. Miles to prominent ministers in Wisconsin with whom he has influence and who, in their tum, are in a position to be helpful.  The first thing I want to direct your attention to, Mr. Emer_y, and refresh vour recolfoction as to, is this. The letter of Mr. Mulhall, with refermce to which you testified, being letter 1647-164fl, and which is referred  to in the  record  at  page 2791. is dated ,Tune  2:3, 1908.	The letwr I have just r<'ad you ts dated ,July  7,  1908, and  apologizes for not  having answered :\Ir. :'.\fulhall's letters.	Now, is not this letter of,July 7 an answer to that vory fottPr which you hold in your hand 1lr. EMERY. It mav he, Senator.  &-nator REED. And is· not this also true, that you are  mistaken when you say that you harl an intt'rview with Mr. Mulhall a few days afterwards? Can  you  not  tell  from  this  lotter  of  ,Tuly 7, addressed to him at Superior, Wis., that he wRS still out in the district of Mr.,Jenkins?lfr. EMERY. It is verv li.kelv, Senator.  Senator REED. So tl:iat it fs very evident you were mistaken when you said you did not answer the letter of ,Tune 2 , iind you were evi­ dently m1Staken about  having  had  a conversation  with Mr. Mulhall in which you repudiated his lotter of June 23, Gr repudiated this state­ ment in it that vou have criticized·?  Mr. EMERY. It is quite possible, Senator, that the interview was later; looking  back  over the  matter, five years ago.	Of course I have not seen any of my letters, or had any chance to refresh my recollection.  Senator REED. I understand. I am not criticizing you; I am trying to get the facts.Mr. EMERY. Yes, sir: and I am trying the best I can to give themt-0 vou. '  Senator REED. It appears from this letter of July 7, written some 10 days, or some 14 days, perhaps, after the letter of  June 23, that you not only did not repudiate his statement which you  criticized this morning, but that you were fully in accord with his letter, and did start to raise money-tried to raise money.}fr. E11ERY. It is very evident from that letter that some effortwas made, but I had no--Senator REED. It is also evident that you made a personal effort,is it not? ..Mr. EMERY. You mean that I personally tried to rnise money?
3936	MAINTENANCE OF A LOBB\' TO l:NFIXEXCE LEGISLATION.Senator REED. Yes.  Mr. EMERY. I  can only  give  you,  in  connection  \\c-ith  the  letter, my very  best  recollection,  which  is  that  I  made  no  s}lecial  t'ff6rt. I may have talked to  sonrnho<ly  about  it  in  a  genera  way,  but  I can not recall anybody.Senator REED. I donot know what you mean hy "special effort.",lust let me read the letter  again,  to  refresh  your  recollection.  I realize that a busy man, with  thousands of  things  on  his  hands,  has to  go somewhat  by  memoranda  and  rt•cords.  I  have  had  to  do  it. I am calling your attention to the languagti of this letter:I realize very keenly the critical nature of the Wisconsin situation-  That referred to Mr. Mulhe.ll's letter where he told vou that it we.s going  to  be a hard fight·	·Mr. EMERY. Yes, sir.Sena.tor REED. And this letter goes on:and I hope we have some lineA out that will secure practical a.,;.,i tanre withinfew days.Now, whom did you mean by that?  Mr. EMERY. I suppose I referred to a number of my associates or officers.	As I told ,}'"OU, Senator--  Senator REED. You must have had a talk with them about it, then--Mr. EMERY.  Yes.	As I told you--  Senator REED  (continuing).  And  arranged  to  get  the  lines  out. That much had been  done, and  you  had  been  personally concerned  in it to the extent of talking it  over  with  other  members,  or  with some of the other officers of the a..'isociation. That is correct, is it not¥Mr. EMERY. Yes sir.  Senator REED. Now, I continue with this letter. The practical assistance, of course, that you expected to get, was money. That is what your were writing about 1Mr. EMERY. Yes sir.Senator  REED.  Theletter continues:  The extreme heat of the past week has apparently driven out of New York every · man whom we have been most anxious to see-Those were the capitalists, the manufacturers, the men who hadmoney, that you referred to, were they not1 I will read it again:  The extreme heat of the past week has apparently driven out of New York every man whom we have been most anxious to see, which has _prevented the work I have been most anxious to do here in connection with the Jenkins decision.  The word "decision" should evidently be "election." The stenographer probably made a mistake. That referred to people you had expected to see, did it not 1Mr. EMERY. Very evidently, yes sir. Senator REED. Now, going a little further:I am attending after to-morrow a convention of the State Bankers' A880Ciation­The.t was the State Bankers' Association of New York, was =t not¥ Mr. EMERY. Yes sir.Senator REED. I will read on:at which I expect to find some of the men I am m011t anxioll! to see.You di.d attend that bankers' association meeting, did you iMr. EMERY. Yes.
