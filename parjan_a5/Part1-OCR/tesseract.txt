Mr. McCarter. Letter No. 2757-2760, it apparently being a letter
from Mulhall to Schwedtman, contains the following statement:

Thad a telegram from Mr. Emery on Friday night, calling me to New York on Satur-
day morning.

Senator REED. What is the date of that letter?

Mr. McCarter. It is dated June 2, 1909. I continue reading:

We had a conference in relation to the Washington situation, and he stated what he
wished me to do and gave me to understand plainly what he wishes done while he is
absent. He has put it up to me to fix the Judiciary Committee and the Labor Com-
mittee while he is away, and I feel certain I can have this done, as we have been
working upon this for some time. It looks as though we would meet with success all
along the line.

What have you to say in regard to that statement ?

Senator Reep. Now, I do submit, if the committee please—I have
made the objection several times and our friend here, I know, under-
stands—that the proper way to examine the witness is to ask him
whether or not certain things took place, and not to read somebody
else’s testimony or statement and ask the witness to comment upon
it, or to ask him whether it is true or false.

Mr. McCarter. I will endeavor to accommodate myself, Senator
Reed, to your desire. I thought it was the quickest way to do it.

Senator Reep. It is the quickest way, of course.MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION. 8915

Senator Cummins. In view of the way in which our witnesses have
been examined here, it seems to me that the question is proper one.
He is not referring to any testimony. .

Mr. McCarter. No, this is a letter.

Senator Reep. He is asking the witness now purely for comment
upon a letter. He says ‘“‘What have you to say in regard to that
statement’”’ ?

Senator Cummins. He of course means to call out his recollection
in regard to that statement.

Senator Reep. I should not think that it would necessarily call—
I do not want to be captious about it, but I submit to the com-
mittee that where the witness is an attorney, to begin with, and
he has been put upon the stand here in the attitude of a witness
for what they are pleased to term ‘‘the defense,” my idea of the
weight: which must be given to his testimony would be considerably
affected by the question whether it is given in one way or whether
it is given in another way.

The Cuarrman. I think he may answer the question.

Senator Cummins. Yes.

The CHarrMAN. Go ahead, Mr. McCarter, and frame the question.

Mr. McCarter. This letter says, ‘‘He” (meaning Emery) ‘‘has
pe it up to me” (Mulhall) “to fix the Judiciary Committee and the

abor Committee while he” (Emery) “is away.” Had you done any
such thing as that with Mr. Mulhall?

Mr. Emery. Why, no, sir.

Senator Nerson. Speak a little louder.

Mr. Emery. No, sir.

Mr. McCarter. What, if anything, did you say or do with Mr.
Mulhall with regard to any activity he was to display touching the
formation or the attitude of the Judiciary Committee and the Labor
Committee, while you were away at this time, which was June 2, 1909?

Senator Reep. Will you please give me the number of that letter
again? I have forgotten it.

Mr. McCarter. It is 2757-2760.

Mr. Emery. I do not recollect distinctly the details of the conver-
sation which is alluded to in that letter, which doubtless took place ;
but I am positive that no conversation passed between us with ref-
erence to any such statement as that. 1 was going away to be gone
some time, and at most could have asked Col. Mulhall to inform me
as to any sppamimenis made on this committee during my absence.

Senator Reep. Oh, I object.

The CuarrMan. Just state the facts.

Mr. Emery. That is my best recollection, Senator.

The CuarrmMan. You say at most you could have done so and so.
State the facts.

Mr. Emery. I say I could not undertake to relate the conversation.
That I do not undertake to do; but my best recollection is that, so far
as relates to that subject, I requested him to keep me informed as to
any change in the personnel of these committees during my absence.

ir. McCarter. Did you, either at that or at any other time, put
it up to Mr. Mulhall to fix either the Judiciary Committee or the
Committee on Labor?
Mr. Emery. I did not.3916 MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION.

Mr. McCarter. I want to return for a moment to the McMichael
matter, which I overlooked, and of which you reminded me.

Did you ever make a payment to Mulhall for McMichael ?

Mr. Teer. Yes.

Mr. McCarter. When, and under what circumstances ?

Mr. Emery. While Mr. McMichael was sending to my office with
the documents and bills I referred to, Col. Mulhall, who had made the
arrangement, suggested that he be paid, I think it was $15 a month.

Senator REEep. $15?

Mr. Emery. I think so, yes, sir; and that money was paid to Col.
Mulhall, and I suppose he gave it to Mr. McMichael. It may have
been as much, during some months of the time he served, as $20. It
never exceeded that, that is positive; and the relation terminated
entirely in 1910, when I went to Europe.

‘ Eenaton NeEtson. When you left for Europe, or when you came
aC.

Mr. Emery. When I left, Senator.

Mr. McCarter. There has been some testimony here with regard
to the use of a secret room in the basement of this building, and your
assent to that proposition. Tell us all you know about that.

Mr. Emery. Col. Mulhall at various times suggested the establish-
ment of what he called a bureau of information, from which con-
gressional documents, bearing upon the variou’ subjects, or argu-
ments which had been had before various committees here, should
be distributed. Sometime in 1911 he made the definite suggestion
to me that the secretary of some congressional friend had offered to
permit him to use a room here in the Capitol building, for the purpose of
accumulating documents, and putting them in there and sending
them out under frank to the members of the association and of other
organizations which would be interested in such distribution, and I
told the Colonel at the time that it was an utterly impossible proposal.

Senator Netson. What did you say?

Mr. Emery. That it was an utterly impossible proposal; that the
use even under such circumstances of any room in the Capitol would
invite a very proper criticism, and that I under no circumstances
would agree to have any further discussion of it.

Later than that, when I was in New York, Mr. Bird told me that
the Colonel had made the same proposition to him, and he wanted to
know what I thought of such a thing, and I said to him that it was
too absurd to discuss; that it would justly invite criticism, and that it
must not be considered, and told him what I had said to the Colonel.
I used probably stronger language than I am using now. That is the
last I heard of the matter. Mr. Bird told me he intended to immedi-
ately write to the Colonel and condemn the matter, just as he had
already condemned it in conversation with him.

Senator Reep. Mr. Chairman, may I interrupt? I want to make
an inquiry of the committee. We have heretofore agreed on adjourn-
ing at 12 o’clock. We changed the time of adjournment this morning
to 11 o’clock because of the Senate convening at that hour, and I want
to know if it is proper for us to go on while the Senate is in session, or
whether we should stop now. I know Senator Cummins particularly
wants to be at the tariff debate, and there is very good reason why
he should have that desire. I was going to make this suggestion to
the committee, whether it is not possible for us to either take up theseMAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION. 3917

matters at night sessions and get through with them, or to try and
have the members arrange very soon for a day when we can start in
in the morning and run through, until we get through with Mr.
Emery’s testimony, because the matter is dragging—of itself; I am
not criticizing anybody.

Mr. McCarter. No.

Senator ReEep. And also because I myself am very anxious, and
I think all the members are anxious, to hear the tariff discussions.
They are getting pretty warm and interesting, and are on important
matters. I wanted to see pe what the committee thought about
it, and therefore I thought I would stop here for that suggestion.

Senator Cummins. Mr. Chairman, I must be in the Senate this
morning, but I do not think I will be engaged there more than a few
minutes, for I do not now intend to do what Chad expected to do at this
time. However, I feel that I would like to be present at least most
of the time during the tariff debate. I am perfectly willing that
the examination of Mr. Emery shall go on in my absence. I can read
the record.

Senator Reep. Mr. McCarter, have you an idea about how long it
will take you to conclude?

Mr. McCarter. I should think in half an hour I should be through
with Mr. Emery on what I call our direct examination, unless there
is some other interruption.

Senator Reep. Yes.

Mr. McCarter. I have gotten down now to a few specific questions
that I wanted to ask him concerning the business. I do not think it
will take more than half or three-quarters of an hour, Senator Reed.

Senator REEp. Suppose we go on until 12 o’clock to-day?

Senator Netson. And let us not interrupt any more thar is nec-
essary.

The Cuarmman. What length of time was covered by your deposits
in the bank as shown by the slips exhibited here?

Senator Netson. From what time to what time?

Mr. Emery. All of 1909, 1910 and 1911.

Senator Nezson. Three years?

Mr. Emery. Yes, sir.

Senator NEtson. None before that on the slips?

Mr. Emery. None before that on the slips.

Senator Nerson. And none after that?

Mr. Emery. No, sir. I can give you all my checks for 1912.

Mr. McCarter. You see Mr. Mulhall left the employ of the asso-
ciation, practically, in October, 1911, although theoretically his resig-
nation took effect January 1, 1912.

Mr. Emery, I refer you to page 2744 of the printed record of these
proceedings, where I find that Mr. Mulhall testified as follows——

Senator REEp. Can you not avoid that kind of examination?

The CuarrMan. You might refresh his memory and then ask the
question.

Senator REED. That might lead'us a long ways off. I think you
can see where that might possibly take us.

Mr. McCarter. I am frank to = Senator Reed, that over in the
ancient and honorable State of New Jersey that is the universal way of
contradicting a witness.3918 MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY ‘TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION.

The CHAIRMAN. Well, you might ‘read it into the record and then
ask your -question.

CCARTHR. On page 2744 oe the printed record in this: case
appears the, following:

Mr. MuLHALL. Mr. Cole had served two terms in Congress. Before he was nominated
the second time-he pledged himself that he would not run a third time. There had
been certain influences brought to bear on him here in W: n to stand for another ~
nomination. That was unusual in that district. They asked me to go out there and
try to have him renominated. .

Senator Reep: Was he renominated?

Mr. Muiwa.t. Yes.

Senator Netson. That is an Ohio district? -

“Mr. Mutwa.y. Yes.

Senator Reep. Who asked you to make that trip?

Mr. Mutwatt. Mr. Sherman.

Senator Reep. Was Mr. Cole one of the men that was regarded | as friendly t to the
interests of the Manufacturers’ Association?

Mr. Mutttau.. Extremely 6o—subservient; so subservient that Mr. Emery sent for
him on one occasion. He told me that Mr. Cole had not been acting good toward the
Ohio delegation or with the Ohio delegation+they were pPposi ng Sp peaker Cannon
and the Cannon rules—and I went to the Capitol and broug le, and I brought
him to Mr. Emery’s office, and-Mr. Emery gave him a scolding there on the carpet in

‘his own office in this city.

I ask you if any such interview between youfself. and Mr. Cole ever
took place. *

Mr. Emery. It did. not.

a McCarter. Was Mr. Cole, to your knowledge, ever in your
office? .

Mr. Emery. No, sir; he was not. Ido npt know Mr. Cole.

. Mr. McCarter. Did you ever. have: any such interview with him,
anywhere ?

r. Emery. No; I never nrét him, ‘I do not know him.

Mr. McCarter. On page 2782 appears an extract from a letter the
number of which does not appear-on that Page A qniste from mat
extract.

Senator Netson. Whose letter is ita

Mr. McCarter. The letter is from Mr. Mulhall to Mr. Sehwedt-
man, I think, sir.

Senator REED. On the bottom of the preceding page you will see *
the following:

Senator Reep. I hand you 1594-1596;

That fixes the number of the letter.

Mr. McCarter. Yes, sir. From ‘this lottor I read the following
extract: :

I wish to call your attention to something I failed to get in my report that I sent
you from this office on last Tuesday. That is, in relation to Mr. Emery'sand my inter-
view with Judge Jenkins, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Judge Jenkins
told Mr. Emery and I if he could be reelected to Congress again that he could so
arrange it that” he could get a man to take Littlefield’s place whe would be just as |
effective for us inthe next Congress as Littlefield has been. This he agreed to do. +
9 we would aid him in every way we possibly could.

ou recall, any such interview ‘between Mr. Emery and Mr,
sulhal and Judge Jenkins as is there teferred to? ‘
Emery. I donot.

Me McCarter. Did it.take place?

Mr. Emery. No, sir: The interview may ave taken place, but
no such conversation occurred.MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION. 8919

Mr. McCarTer. At page 2784 I read an extract from letter 1610—
1612, received by Mr. Mulhall from Mr. Schwedtman. The extract
to which I desire to call the witness’s attention reads as follows:

Mr. Van Cleave has had a number of conferences with Mr. Bird, and he has spoken
to him about your work, and it is understood that your relationship with the St.
Louis office is exactly the same as it has been in the past, » amely, that you are under
direct instructions from the St. Louis office. This, however, does not lessen the
necessity of working in absolute harmony with the New York office and in the closest
possible touch with Mr. Bird, the business manager. While working under direct
instructions from St. Louis, your own good sense tells you that when in the New
York office it is necessary to comply with the rules and regulations under which that
office is working.

Directing your attention to that paragraph, I ask you whether or
not it is true that during the parted when you and Mr. Mulhall were
collaborating in Washington, as you have described, he was under
directions of the St. Louis office, and later under directions of the
New York office, and not under your immediate control?

Mr. Emery. May I ask the date of that letter? I did not catch it.

Mr. McCarter. It does not give the date here It is letter 1610-
1612. I will ask the clerk to give us the date

Mr. Emery. Well, I can say generally, Mr. McCarter.

The CLERK OF THE CommiTTEE. The letter is dated June 2, 1908.

Mr. McCarter. You may go on, Mr. Emery.

Mr. Emery. I can say generally with respect to the control of
Mr. Mulhall’s actions from the time I came to Washington in 1908,
that while he was here in Washington he gave me any assistance he
could on the lines that I have described; Bas he was very frequently
called away, or went away, and I understood he did so andor directions
from St. Louis; and when he returned he was subject to such instruc-
tions or orders as he had from there. He gave me generally the same
assistance as I have described, until in 1910 he was specifically placed
under Mr. Bird’s directions and orders, and obeyed such orders as he
received from there. When he came to Washington and came here
to assist me in any way, he came here pursuant to a request by me to
Mr. Bird, or an order from Mr. Bird.

Mr. McCarter. On page 2791 of the record appears a letter, No.
1647, which appears to be written to James A. Emery by Mr. Mulhall.
I call attention to the third paragraph.

* Mr. Emery. Will you give me the date of that letter?

Mr. McCarter. I have not the date here. I will ask the clerk to
give the date.

The CLERK OF THE ComMITTEE. The letter is dated June 23, 1908.

Mr. McCarter. The third paragraph of that letter, as quoted in
the record, reads:

From the information I could get from those gentlemen it appears to me that we
have a good fighting chance to win this district, providing that you can do as you told
Judge Jenkins you would do, to aid him by raising some funds in the East, so he could
paths necessary workers going here as soon as possible to do so. The judge remem-

the promise you made him in Washington and is very anxious to hear from you
at the earliest moment.

a reference to that, do you remember the Jenkins campaign of
1908

Mr. Emery. Yes, sir.3920 MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION.

Mr. McCarter. Do you remember an interview between you and
Judge Jenkins, in Washington or elsewhere, with reference to that

campaign ¢

M. MERY. I had a talk with Judge Jenkins in the winter of 1908,
the only conversation I remember having had with him. I did not
know Judge Jenkins except slightly. had appeared before his
committee and discussed matters there, but I do not recall having but
one conversation with him personally.

Mr. McCarter. And that was later than this letter, apparently..

Mr. Emery. I mean the winter of 1907-8, the spring of 1908, I
had a conversation with him. I can not say certainly whether Mr.
Mulhall was present or not, but I remember meeting Judge Jenkins in
his committee room in the course of an inquiry I was ma as tosome
hearings, and I sat down and talked to him for maybe 10 minutes. In
that conversation he discussed his coming campaign. He spoke of the
fact that he was going to have a very stiff fight, that the labor organiza-
tions were criticizing him very sharply for the position he had taken on
injunction legislation, and expressed very strongly, as I remember, his
determination to never change his views on the subject, because they
had been his views all his life as alawyer. I recall saying to him very
distinctly that I thought every business man in the country was a
debtor to him for the position which he had so boldly taken, and the
views which he had so freely expressed. That was about the extent of
the conversation. There was nothing more than that. I think I
was introduced to Mr. Jenkins that time by his brother—a younger
man, a Mr. Jenkins, who was either secretary to Judge Jenkins, or
connected with the committee in some way, I do not remember

recisely what. That is the only conversation I ever had with
udge Jenkins, other than the discussion that might have occurred
with him in the course of an argument. That is the only conversa-
tion I ever had with him prior to the campaign of 1908 in his district.

Mr. McCarter. Did you at that time or any other time agree with
him, or say to him, that you would raise some funds in the East ?

Mr. Emery. No, sir; I did not.

net Reep. You got this letter from Mr. Mulhall, did you
not

Mr. Emery. I do not know. If you will let me see that letter, per-
haps I can tell. I am not sure. [After examining letter:] Yes, sir;
undoubtedly I received that letter.

ia EED. Did you ever write a letter repudiating any part
of it

Mr. Emery. No; I do not think I wrote the Colonel on the sub-
ject at all.

Senator Reep. On the contrary, you and your association con-
tinued to make efforts for Judge Jenkins in that campaign, as is
shown by numerous letters?

Mr. Emery. I deny that I made any efforts.

Senator Rexp. I am not talking about you personally; but did
not your association make efforts in his behalf?

. Emery. I think they did. I have noticed letters to that effect.

Senator Rreep. And not only Mr. Mulhall wrote you, but other
officers of the association wrote you, about this whole matter?

Mr. Emery. I think so.MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION. 8921

Senator Reep. And you never repudiated it, or never wrote back
and said he was writing a lot of stuff that there was no truth in?

Mr. Emery. Mr. Mulhall called on me shortly after that-—

Senator ReEp. You did not repudiate it in person ?

Mr. Emery. I did.

Senator REEep. You remember that?

Mr. Emery. Yes.

Senator ReEep. But you did not write him about it?

o Emery. He called on me shortly after that, I do not remember
when.

Senator REED. Called on you for money, did he not?

Mr. Emery. Yes.

' Senator Reep. And the association went right on raising money
or

Mr. Emery. I was not connected, except remotely, with the National
Association of Manufacturers. I was secretary of the Citizens’ Indus-
trial Association. He called on me in New York on the subject of
raising money, I remember very distinctly. He wanted Mr. Post,
who was the president of the Citizens’ Industrial Association, an
was reputed to be and was in fact a wealthy man, to make a con-
tribution—

Senator Reep. You know there has been produced correspondence
between Mr. Mulhall and Mr. Post showing that Mr. Post was trying
to raise money ?

Mr. Emery. No, I do not think there has been any such corre-
spondence.

Senator ReEp. There is correspondence in here, is there not, which
shows that Mr. Post was trying to help raise that money?

Mr. Emery. No. I think what you have in mind is correspondence
with me in which Mr. Mulhall urged me to get Mr. Post to make some
contr‘bution.

Senator Reep. Is there not such correspondence?

Mr. Emery. I think that is in regard to another matter. I think
it is doubtless the Watson campaign you have in mind.

Senator Reep. Very well. The letters will show.

Mr. Emery. The letters will show; but that is my recollection.
I will only say in connection with it that I told the Colonel it was
impossible to do anything of the kind; that Mr. Post would not con-
tibute, and that I could not help him.

Senator Reep. That you could not help him, although in this conver-
sation with Judge Jenkins, when he told you he was going to have a
hard fight, that the labor unions were going to fight him, you told him
that all the manufacturers of the country were indebted to him; and
did you say anything then about helping him?

Mr. Emery. Nothiig beyond what I have told you, that I thought
they were indebted to him and I felt sure that if anyone passed the
hat in that matter, in view of the position of Judge Jenkins the manu-
facturers all over the country would contribute. But they did not.

Senator Reep. If you said that——

Mr. Emery. I did not say that to Judge Jenkins. I do not want
to be misunderstood.

Senator Reep. Did you not say a little while ago that you did have
8 conversation with Judge Jenkins ?

Mr. Emery. Yes sir.8922 MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION.

Senator Reep. And that in that conversation he told you he was
going to be fought by the labor organizations on account of his injunc-
tion attitude ?

Mr. Emery. Yes sir.

Senator Reep. Did you not say that in that conversation you said
to him in substance—I can not quote the exact language—that you
thought all the manufacturers of the country were indebted to him #

Mr. Emery. Yes sir.

Senator ReEep. Did you not in that conversation also say to him
that you would be glad to assist him in any way you could, or words
to that effect ?

Mr. Emery. I think I did.

Senator Reep. Then do you think that it was at all inconsistent for
Mr. Mulhall to write this. I will have to read the text to get the
sentence out:

From the information I could get from those gentlemen it appears to me that we
have got a good fighting chance to win in this district, providing that you can do as
you told Judge Jenkins you would do, to aid him by raising some funds in the East,
80 he could put the necessary workers going here as soon as possible to do so. The
judge remembered the promise you le him in Washington and is very anxious to

ear from you at the earliest moment.

Do you not think that language is entirely consistent with what
you now say took place?

Mr. Emery. It might be the interpretation of an opinion on my
part turned into a promise. I made no promise; I could not do it;
and there was nothing in the conversation on the part of Judge
Jenkins that indicated a hope of financial assistance.

Senator Reep. When you said to him that the manufacturers were
indebted to him, you thought they would help him?

Mr. Emery. Yes.

Senator Reep. The only way the manufacturers all over the coun-
try could help him would be, not ‘by voting for him, because they
did not live in his district, but by rendering financial help? The only
other way to help him was by cold, hard cash; that is about all that
is left, is it not?

Mr. Emery. Yes; I realize your interpretation of it.

Senator Reep. Particularly in view of the fact that there were no
manufacturers in his district to speak of.

Mr. Emery. But there were many manufacturers in Wisconsin.

Senator Reep. But in Judge Jenkins’s district ?

Mr. Emery. I heard that statement here. I was not familiar with
his district. :

Mr. McCarrer. I now call your attention to page 2940 of the
record, where there is a quotation from a letter from Mulhall to
Schwedtman.

Senator Reep. What is the number of the letter?

Mr. McCarter. 2171-2188. In this letter Mulhall says:

I had a long interview with Mr. Emery on Monday morning and fully went over the
situation with him and went to Paterson on Monday night and had a second interview
with him on Tuesday noon. Mr. Emery has changed his mind about that district.
I gave him a large list of manufacturers in that district, and he started to working

among them for the couple of days that I will be West and will do all he can to help
me out.MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION. 8923

Mr. Emery. What is the date of that?

Mr. McCarter. October 28; 1908. Did you have such an inter-
view with Mr. Mulhall, and did you in fact start the work in the
Hughes district, in Paterson, in that campaign ?

Mr. Emery. I can not say as to having had an interview with him
at that date, but the arrangement there discussed certainly was not
made, nor did I do any work of the kind described. I never went
into anybody’s district.

Senator Reep. You mean you never literally and personally went
into it. Do you mean to say that you did not do anything to affect
the result in that district?

Mr. Emery. At that time?

Senator Resp. Yes.

Mr. Emery. I could not say off hand, Senator. I might have
written letters into the district, or I might have sent literature there.

Senator Reep. That is evidently what this means, instead of your
literally going in and going around to see voters. I do not see that
there would be much good in that.

Mr. McCarter. The language is:

And he started to working among them for the couple of days that I will be West.

Senator Reep. Yes.

Mr. McCarter. I do not know what it means.

Senator Reep. Very well.

Senator Watsu. You said you did not at that time. Did you at
any other time? May I inquire whether at any other time you did
the things charged?

Mr. Emery. No sir, I did not.

Senator Watsu. Then why did you qualify your answer by saying
“at that time” ?

Mr. Emery. I think I was referring to the conversation. I can
not say whether the conversation took place, but I did not do the
things described there, nor did I do them at any other time.

Senator Wars. The qualification came froin yourdell Mr. Emery.

Mr. Emery. That is possible, Senator. I had no mental reserva-
tion about it.

Senator Rreep. Let me ask, were you at this time, October 28,
1908, located in Washington or in New York?

Mr. Emery. In New

Senator Reep. You were just across the river from New Jersey.

Mr. Emery. I was just going to Washington.

Senator Rreep. Many of the manufacturers in New Jersey had
offices in New York City.

Mr. Emery. Why, I suppose so.

Senator Reep. A number of them were members of the organiza-
tion of which you were then the secretary, namely, the—what was
the name of that association ?

Mr. Emery. The Citizens’ Industrial Association of America.

Senator REED. Are vou prepared to say that in that campaign
you did not intercede, by letter or in person, or both, with various
manufacturers who were living in New Jersey, with regard to the
Hughes campaign

Mr. Emery. I do not think I engaged in any activity, Senator,
beyond recommending the distribution in Mr. Hughes’s district of an3924 MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION.

argument which he had made before the subcommittee of the Judi-
ciary Committee with respect to a bill which he proposed, exempting
labor organizations from the Sherman Act. There were a number of
copies of that argument——

Senator Reep. How many?

Mr. Emery. I say there were a number of copies of that argument.

rinted—I do not know how many; maybe four or five thousand—and

recommended their distribution in his district.

Senator Reep. That was an argument in favor of exempting labor
ee eso from the pains, penalties and inhibitions of the Sherman

ct

Mr. Emery. From the Sherman Act.

Senator Reep. Then, of course, it was a proposition which would be
favorably received by organized iabor?

Mr. Emery. Yes, indeed.

Senator Reep. Therefore you did not circulate those four or five
thousand copies of Mr.Hughes’s address among the members of or-
pain abe because that would have helped Hughes instead of

urtin
Mr. Ttieny. Oh, no. I say I suggested its distribution among the
business men in his district.

Senator REEp. You circulated it primarily among the manufac-
turers, did you not?

Mr. Emery. I did not circulate it. It was turned over to the New
York office for circulation.

Senator Reep. I know you did not do the manual work.

Mr. Emery. I suggested the distribution of these copies among
manufacturers, for the purpose of.

Senator Reep. And your suggestion, in the way you made it, was
sufficient to cause the work to be done?

Mr. Emery. Why, yes; I think it was done.

Senator Reep. In addition to the mere sending out to these gentle-
men of the naked remarks of Mr. Hughes, did you not send some
letter or communication, pointing the moral and adorning the tale,
if you please, so that these gentlemen would understand why you
sent them Mr. Hughes’s remarks ?

Mr. Emery. I do not think I did, Senator.

Senator Reep. You know, do you not, that there were circulars
poten out and sent to manufacturers, attacking Hughes because of

is speech that he had made, and because of his labor attitude? You
know that?

Mr. Emery. I think there were, Senator. I do not want you to
misunderstand me. If I had done it I would not hesitate to say so,
because I would not hesitate to write a circular on that subject; but
I have no recollection of having done so in that instance.

Senator REED. They were sent out?

Mr. Emery. I think so.

Senator ReeEp. I do not say whether you wrote it or not, and
I do not care whether you wrote it or not, or whether you had one of
your hired men write it, or whether one of the other members of the
association wrote it; you were fully in accord with that kind of cam-
paign, and you think you did go far enough at least to suggest sending
the speech ¢

Mr. Emery. Oh, yes, I think so.MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION. 8925

Senator Reep. So as a matter of fact, now, so far as you were active
at all in the Hughes matter, you were active against Mr. Hughes?

Mr. Emery. Yes.

Senator Reep. And it was of sufficient importance in that cam-
pee to beat Mr. Hughes, so that the matter in some way, by some-

v, was drawn to your attention

Mr. Emery. You mean the argument he made?

Senator Reep. The campaign was drawn to your attention, and
you took enough interest at least to have Mr. Hughes’s speech sent
out where it would do the most harm to Hughes?

Mr. Emery. Yes. I was present

Senator Reep. Then what is really wrong with this statement in
the letter which says:

I had a long interview with Mr. Emery on Monday morning—

You say you do not remember whether you had that or not, but
you might have had it.

Mr. Emery. Yes.

Senator Reep. I continue:
and fully went over the situation with him and went to Paterson on Monday night
and had a second interview with him on Tuesday noon.

Of course from New York over to Paterson was just a matter of a
few minutes, I suppose.

Mr. Emery. Yes.

Mr. McCarter. About an hour.

Senator Reep. It is just a short run. It is accessible. He says:

Mr. Emery has changed his mind about that district.

From that I take it that you had thought there was no use in trying
to beat Hughes.

Mr. Emery. I do not recollect precisely what it was.

Senator ReeEp. He continues:

I gave him a large list of manufacturers in that district—

You did have this speech sent out to some one, and you did have it
sent to the manufacturers. Of course it is wholly unimportant
whether you got that list yourself, or Mulhall handed it to you; but as
a matter of fact you are not prepared to say that Mulhall dia not give
you a list of manufacturers

Mr. Esrery. Oh, no; only handing me a list of manufacturers, con-
meng the facilities of our office, evidently was carrying coals to New-
castle.

Senator Reep. Except that he might have looked up a list of
manufacturers in that special district. You might not have known
the limits of the congressional district.

Mr. Emery. Oh, no, that is quite true.

Senator ReEep. And he might also have been able to tell you
whether some of these men were specially influential, or would be
likely to be active. That kind of information might not have been
coals to Newcastle, but might have been what Newcastle wanted at
that time. You assent to that, I notice, by nodding your head, but
you ae not say anything so that the stenographer can put it into the
record.

Mr. McCarter. I did not know it was a question.

95088—Pr 46—18——33926 MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION.

Mr. Emery. I did not know it was a question. I thought it was a
statement from you.

Senator REeep. It was leading; almost as leading as the examina-
tion that your counsel has conducted.

Mr. Emery. He profits by example.

Senator REED. os is examining, not cross-examining. I read fur-
ther from this letter:
and he started to working among them for the couple of days that I will be West and
will do all he can to help me out.

You did send out this speech, although you did not go over into the
district, and this does not say you did. What is the matter with
that statement, after all, that it should be challenged?

Mr. McCarter. Is that an argument or a question?

Senator REeEp. I am asking if it is not practically a statement of
facts, as he now admits.

Mr. Emery. Do you want an answer from me, Senator?

Senator REED. Yes.

Mr. Emery. All I can say about it is that the only thing I did
was to recommend the sending out of this argument which Mr. Hughes
had made, and I think the office acted on my recommendation and
sent it out. That is the full extent of my activity in the matter.

Senator ReEp. You are not prepared to say that there was not a
letter sent out with that?

Mr. Emery. Oh, no. Doubtless there was.

Senator ReeEp. That is all.

The CuarrMaNn. You say you had this speech printed. Were the
copies printed by the association ?

fr. .mMeRY. They were printed at the Government Printing Office.

The CHarrman. You had them printed ?

Mr. Emery. Yes.

The Cnarrman. By the Government Printing Office?

Mr. Emery. Yes.

The Cuarrman. And sent them out under whose frank ?

Mr. Emery. I do not know whether they were sent out under a
frank or not.

The Cuarrman. Did the association pay the postage ?

Mr. Emery. I do not know, Senator. J know we paid for the
printing.

The CuarrMan. Was it not your habit to send out speeches all over
this country under somebody's frank ¢

Mr. Emery. Frequently, Senator, yes. .

Senator Reep. Mr. Hughes did not furnish you his frank in this
particular instance?

Mr. Emery. No, I do not think he did.

The CuarrMan. Is it not more than probable that they were sent
out under somebody’s frank ?

Mr. Emery. Very likely. This was an argument made before the
Judiciary Committee.

The Cee, I understand that. They were probably sent out
under somebody’s frank. Under whose frank were they sent?

Mr. Emery. Ido not remember. I will give you my recollection, or
rather my opinion. The argument was made before a subcommittee,
of which Mr. Littlefield was chairman, of the Committee on the Judi-MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION. 3927

ciary of the House, and it is quite likely they were sent out under
Mr. Littlefield’s frank. .

The Cuarrman. It was your custom to use Mr. Littlefield’s frank
to send literature about Congressmen into their districts, was it?

Mr. Emery. No, sir; I only remember one instance in which Mr.
Littlefield’s frank was used ?

The Cuarmman. What was that?

Mr. Emery. To circulate Mr. Littlefield’s speech of 1908.

Senator Reep. Why did you say it was likely that these addresses
of Mr. Hughes were sent out under Mr. Littlefield’s frank?

Mr. Emery. Because of the fact that the argument was made
before the Judiciary Committee, and this was a report of that argu-
ment. We would ask for an order from the chairman of the sub-
committee or of the full committee—for permission—to print the
speech and distribute it.

Senator Reep. ter poo to print it?

Mr. Emery. Yes. ere is no other way that I know of by which
ou can have the Government Printing Office print any speech before
ongress or before any committee, except to get an order from one of

the Senators or Members of the House, and pay for the printing.

Senator Reep. You would get an order and have it printed in the
Government Printing Office? Of course if the speech was taken down
and transcribed, you could have had it printed at a private printing
office without anybody's permission ? .

Mr. Emery. Yes.

Senator Reep. And you could then have sent it out and paid the
postage upon it, and sent it wherever you pleased?

Mr. Emery. Certainly.

Senator ReEp. So that when you got an order from a Congressman
to have it printed in the Government Printing Office, you did it so
that. it could be sent out under a frank?

Mr. Emery. Yes.

Senator Reep. And in this instance you think it was probably Mr.
Littlefield’s frank?

Mr. Emery. Yes, I should assume that, just from the circumstances
of the discussion. I may not be stating it accurately, but that is
my assumption, because it was the practice—

Senator Reep. You did not have to get permission from the
chairman of the committee in order to get a mublic proceeding of that
kind printed at the Government Printing Office. Any Congressman
could have it done.

Mr. Emery. Any Congressman; yes.

Senator Reep. But your mind naturally drifts to Mr. Littlefield?
‘5 Emery. No, my mind does not naturally drift to Mr. Little-
field.

Senator Reep. It just did drift?

Mr. Emery. I offered that as a reasonable explanation. I wanted
to be as frank with you as possible.

Senator Reep. Why; certainly.

Mr. Emery. I gave you the name of the man who would be most
likely to give it.

Senator Reep. I think vour mind was proceeding along a very
logical road at that time.8928 MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION.

The CuatrMan. These documents were sent out into that district
for the purpose of defeating Mr. Hughes?

Mr. Emery. Why, that was our purpose, certainly.

The Cuarrman. And then you used the Government Printing
Office, and the frank of a Member of Congress to send literature into
a district, to beat a Member of Congress #

Mr. Emery. That might have been my purpose. The purpose
was to distribute information with respect to Mr. Hughes’s opinions,
which Mr. Hughes had publicly expressed.

The Cuarrman. But I understand your ultimate purpose was to
defeat him?

Mr. Exery. That was my purpose. I suppose Mr. Hughes was
very proud of his speech.

The CHarrMan. our purpose was to defeat him?

Mr. Emery. Yes; just as the American Federation of Labor uses
the franks of Members of Congress, and sends literature, for the same
reason.

“Senator Reep. We will not try the American Federation of Labor
now. If it is doing wrong with franks, we will get at that.

Mr. Emery. I call your attention to the practice, because it is a
common practice.

Senator Reep. It seems that the defense, as it has been termed,
offers the excuse that somebody else has done it too.

Mr. Emery. I do not offer it as an excuse, Senator.

The CuarrMan. Suppose we get back to the examination.

Mr. Emery. I want you to understand exactly what I did, because
if I did wrong I am perfectly willing to be criticized for it. I
have always assumed that whenever there was a public debate in
the House or Senate, or an argument before a committee, the argu-
ment or the debate became a public document when it was printed.

The CHairMAN. You did not know it was against the law for any
corporation or association to use the frank of any Congressman to
aed ont documents? You did not know that was against the law,

id you

Mr. Emery. Any corporation ?

The Cnarrman. Any corporation or association, or anybody
else, without the Congressman——

Mr. Emery. Why?

The Cuarrman. To use his frank, to send out documents.

Mr. Emery. No, sir; I had never supposed that.

The CuarrMan. Your attention has been called to it, has it not?

Mr. Emery. It was called to it in the House the other day. I had
a distinguished precedent——

The Cuarrman. “Sugar at a Glance’?

Mr. Emery (continuing). In the judicial conduct of the present

vernor of New York. Thatwas averynotorious matter. Itwastried
in the courts of the District of Columbia here, and Gov. Sulzer.

The CuarrMan. That is not the question I asked you. Your at-
tention has been called to the fact that it was against the law.

Mr. Emery. Yes; Mr. Stafford in the House committee the other
day raised that question with me, and I gave him that illustrious
example.

The CuarrMan. Proceed, Mr. McCarter.MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION, 3929

Mr. Emery. I thought that was what guided him.

Mr. McCarter. I want to say that Senator Reed has referred four
or five times to our using the word ‘‘defense.” I adopted that ex-
pression from the chairman of the committee, who said ‘‘the defensa
will now have a chance to put in their testimony.” It was an ex-
pression used as a colloquialism. I did not suppose——

Senator Regp. I eel it in the way I did only because I did not
want to put myself in the attitude of saying that anybody was on his
defense. Therefore I said that it had been referred to in that way.

The Cuarrain. And you used the words ‘‘the defense, as it has
been termed,” when you used it.

Mr. McCarter. Now, Mr. Emery:

Mr. k Mery. Pardon me if I make an inquiry, merely for my own
information. You asked me a question, Mr. Chairman, and I do not
know whether you intende:l to imply that I was violating a law or
urging a violation of law.

The CHarrman. Have you since learned:

Mr. Emery. Did you mean the sending of literature into a district
for the purpose of cefeating somebody, or the using of a frank?

The Cuarrman. The using of a frank.

Mr. Emery. Oh.

Mr. McCarter. I direct your attention to a letter quoted on page
2949 of the record, which seems to be 2213, 2214, written by Mulhall
to Schwedtman. This letter is dated December 10, 1908. In this
letter I find the following:

We have secured in the person of George R. Malby, a Representative from New
York, a man who will fill the bill entirely in Judge Jenkins’s place when he finishes

his term as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. We are working to make Mr. Malby
chairman of that committee, and this has been entirely satisfactory to Mr. Emery, and

I think it is a splendid move.
On the next page, page 2950 of the printed record, is the following:

Senator Reep. What committee was that?

Mr. Mutua. The Committee on the Judiciary.

Senator Rerp. Why were you trying to make up that committee?

Mr. Mutwatv. They were trying to get Mr. Malby on that committee. I guess that
is what it means.

Senator Reep. Why did you want him on that committee?

Mr. Mutua.v. To take the place of Judge Jenkins.

Senator Reep. Why were you particularly selecting this man?

Mr. Mornay. Because Mr. Emery positively stated that he had interviewed Mr.
Malby on several occasions, and that he thought he would take Judge Jenkins’s place,
and along the same lines, and if appointed on the committee, he would be beneficial
to the manufacturers while in that position.

Do you remember the fact of the candidacy of Mr. Malby for the
position fonmerly ogpupied by Judge Jenkins ?

Mr. Emery. chairman of the Judiciary Committee?

Mr. McCarter. Yes.

Mr. Emery. No, I do not recollect. He may have been a candi-
date, but——

Mr. McCarter. Did you state, positively or otherwise-—

Senator Netson. Do you know anything about it?

Mr. Emery. No, sir; I did not know he was a candidate for the
chalrmasostap He may have been, but I do not remember it,

nator.8930 MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION.

Mr. McCarter. Did you state, positively or otherwise—

Senator Reep. You say you do not know whether he was a candi-
date for the chairmanship? Had he been a member of the com-
mittee prior to this?

Mr. Emery. What is the date of that letter?

Mr. McCarter. December 10, 1908.

Mr. Emery. My best recollection is that he was a member of the
committee at that time. I know that he was a member of the com-
mittee in the spring of 1908, when we argued the Pearre bill before
that committee, and he was also a member of the subcommittee
before which we argued the Hepburn-Warner bill that Senator Nelson
nepories on in the Senate. at also was in the spring of 1908, I
think.

Senator ReEp. Very well.

Mr. McCarter. Did you state that you had interviewed Mr. Malby
on several occasions, and that you thought he would take Judge
Jenkins’s place, and along the same lines, and if appointed on the
committee he would be beneficial to the manufacturers while in that
position ?

Mr. Emery. I know that I talked to Mr. Malby quite a number of
times. He was a member of the committee before which I argued a
number of bills, but I have no recollection of ever having talked with
Mr. Malby—I know I did not talk with him—on the subject of his
being chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary.

Senator Netson. Did you make any efforts along that line in any

. way, shape, or manner, to have him made chairman of the committee ?

Mr. Emery. No sir. :

Mr. McCarter. Did you have any talk with Mr. Mulhall in which
he said he thought Malby would be a fine successor to Jenkins, and
all that kind of thing, such as is stated in that testimony ?

Mr. Emery. That J could not say, sir. I might have made some
remark about Mr. Malby. I could not say.

Senator Reep. Before you pass this; Mr. McCarter, this testimony
reads this way:

Mr. MuHa. Because Mr. Emery positively stated that he had interviewed Mr.
Malby on several occasions, and that he thought he would take Judge Jenkins’s place,
and along the same lines, and if appointed on the committee he would be beneficial
to the manufacturers while in that position.

That nowhere states that Mr. Emery talked with Mr. Malby about
making him chairman. Neither does it state that he talked with
Mr. Malby about his taking Judge Jenkins’s place. Neither does it
state that he talked with Mr. Malby and that Mr. Malby agreed or
stated that he would act along the same iines. It only says that
Mr. Mulhall had talked with Mr. Emery, and Mr. Emery said he had
inferriswd Mr. Malby on several occasions. It does not say about
what.

Senator Watsn. That is right, is it not, Mr. Emery?

Mr. Emery. Very likely.

Senator Watsn. That you had interviewed Mr. Malby on several
occasions.

Mr. Emery. I say that is very likely, because I appeared a number
of times before the committee, and I may have talked to Mr. Malby
during the time of the sessions.MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION. 8931

Senator Watsu. That reads, ‘that he thought he would take Judge
a eikioes place.” Did you have that idea, that Mr. Malby might be
chosen

Mr. Emery. No, I did not think that, because he was the last man
on the committee, as I recollect. He was a new Congressman, and
there must have been 10 men between him and the chairmanship of
the committee—10 or 12.

The Cuarrman. Did you not prefer him to Mr. Parker of New
Jersey ?

Mr. Emery. Why Hit; I did not have any opinion on that subject.

Mr. McCarter. That was away back in 1908.

Senator Watsu. However, you did have a rather high opinion of
Mr. Malby ?

Mr. Emery. Oh, yes.

Senator Watsu. And you did feel that it would be a very nice
thing for the Manufacturers’ Association if a man entertaining his
views should take the place of the chairman of the committce?

Mr. Emery. In the abstract, Senator, that might be true; but I
never had thought of Mr. Malby—I do not remember ever having
thought of him as chairman of the committee.

Senator Watsu. Without any reference whatever to whether you
actually did have any such talks with Mr. Mulhall or not, there is no
sentiment there attributed to you that you did not actually entertain,
is there ?

Mr. Emery. There is a sentiment expressed there as to my opinion
of Mr. Malby, or my views that he would be or ought to be or could
be chairman of the committee. I do not recollect ever thinking of
Mr. Malby in connection with the chairmanship of the committee.

Senator Watsu. Outside of that there is nothing that you care
to deny, is there?

Mr. Emery. Except that I had anything to do with Mr. Malby’s——

Senator Watsn. It is not suggested at all.

Mr. Emery. I understood as it was read that it did so suggest.:

Senator Watsu. No; there is not a suggestion here that you had
exercised vourself in any direction.

Mr. Emery. If you will pardon me, there is a line there which I
could not gather when Senator Reed read it; there is a mixture there
as to whether Mr. Malby was aspiring to be a member of the com-
mittee or chairman of the committee.

Senator WatsH. Not at all.

Mr. Emery. It speaks there of “‘member of the committee,” as
though that were the thought. ,

Senator Watsu. The testimony is simply as follows:

Senator Waxsu. I think that letter should be read. I will read this part of it.
The letter was then read. I read further:

Senator Reev. What committee is that?

Mr. Mutnact. The Committee on the Judiciary.

Senator Reep. Why were you trying to make up that committee?

Mr. Mutua. They were trying to get Mr. Malby on that committee. I guess that
is what it means.

Mr. Emery. Get himonthecommittee. That is what I referred to.

Senator Watsu. “They” were trying.
Mr. McCarrTer. That is, the association.3932 MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION,

Senator Watsu. Yes. I read further:

Senator Reep. Why did you want him on that committee?

Mr. Muuatt. To take the place of Judge Jenkins.

Senator Reep. Why were you particularly selecting this man?

We were inquiring about Mr. Mulhall’s activity. He was going
to get this man made chairman, and he gives his reasons. When
asked ‘‘Why were you particularly selecting this man ¢” he says:

Mr. Mutaaty. Because Mr. Emery positively stated that he had interviewed
Mr. Malby on several occasions, and that he thought he would take Judge Jenkins’s
place, and along the same lines, and if appointed on the committee, he would be

eneficial to the manufacturers while in that position.

You think you did not say that, because you did not think of him
in that connection ?

Mr. Emery. When he says ‘‘he thought,” does he mean that I
thought or that Mr. Malby thought ?

Senator Watsu. No, he says “he thought.’’ That means you.

Mr. Emery. Yes, sir.

Senator Watsy. Whether you said that or not, you did think that,
that Mr. Malby would be a good man for the manufacturers ?

Mr. Emery. Yes.

Senator WatsH. So, what is there that you feel you ought to
repudiate?

. Emery. The first statement, that we were endeavoring to get
him on the committee.

Senator WatsH. But he does not attribute that to you. Mr. Mul-
hall’s conclusion is that the National Association of Manufacturers
wanted to get Mr. Malby on there. He does not attribute anything
to you in that connection.

. McCarter. Why not read the letter in that connection? The
letter reads:

We are working to make Mr. Malby chairman of that committee, and this has been
entirely satisfactory to Mr. Emery, and I think it is a splendid move.

Senator Wausu. ‘‘We are”; that is, Mr. Mulhall and some one else;
and it is satisfactory to Mr. Emery. I suppose Mr. Emery would not
ikerte have us understand that it would not have been satisfactory
to : :

Mr. Emery. Oh, no. But it imputes to me a knowledge that I
did not possess of an effort to make some one a member of a com-
mittee.

Senator Watsu. But if they had been doing it, it would have met
your entire approval? You would have been glad to have them do
anyening they could to get that place for Mr. Malby?

. Emery. I would not have had any objection to any legitimate
endeavor; but so far as any effort to make Mr. Malby a member of
the committee was concerned, it is obvious I could not have enter-
tained it, because Mr. Malby was a member of the committee.

Senator Rezp. How about a subcommittee?

Mr. Emery. What about it?

Senator Reep. How about Mr. Malby being made chairman of a
subcommittee to which these bills that you were specially interested
in might go?

Mr. Emery. What of it?

Senator Reep. I say, how about an effort being made to make Mr.
Malby chairman of such a subcommittee ?MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION. 38933

Senator Waxsu. That could not be so, because this letter reads:

We have secured in the person of Mr. George R. Malby, a Representative from New
York, aman who will fill the bill entirely in Judge Jenkins’s place when he finishes his
term as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. We are working to make Mr. Malby
chairman of that committee, and this has been entirely satisfactory to Mr. Emery, and
1 think it isa splendid move.

Senator Reep. I want to return for a moment to the Judge Jenkins
matter.

Mr. Emery. Will you pardon me a moment? If I have not made
myself clear to the Senator, I desire, in justice to myself, to aay that
so far as I was concerned I knew of no move to make Mr. Malby
chairman of the committee, and if such a move was in existence in
the mind of Mr. Mulhall I had no knowledge of it. I do not know of

ny other effort having been made by the Manufacturers’ Association
or by Mr. Malby.

The Cuarrman. Judge Jenkins at that time had been defeated,
had he?

Mr. Emery. I do not know the date.

Senator Waxsu. But you would have entirely approved of it if you
had known of it?

Mr. Emery. Why, if Mr. Malby had been chairman of the committee,
I certainly would not have objected to it. But I want it distinctly
understood that we made no such effort to make him chairman.

Senator WatsH. You say you made no effort; but you do not mean
to say the Manufacturers’ Association made no effort ?

Mr. Emery. So far as I know, the Manufacturers’ Association made
no effort.

Senator Waxsn. While you did not know it, Mr. Mulhall evidently
knew it when he wrote this letter.

Mr. McCarrer. Is not that a psychological question ?

Senator Watsu. No, it is not a psychological question. The im-

rtance of the matter consisted, not in whether Mr. Emery knew it,

ut in whether the association knew it.

Mr. McCarter. We are examining Mr. Emery now.

The Cuarrman. I think it is a little out of order, because it is cross-
examination.

Senator Reep. I will make it in order.

You and Mr. Schwedtman were on good terms?

Mr. Emery. Certainly.

Senator Reep. You had daily communications with him?

Mr. Emery. Oh, no :

Senator Reep. Well, you had frequent communications, and there
are in the files hundreds of letters between you and Mr. Schwedtman ?

Mr. Emery. Yes, sir.

Senator Reep. You say that you did not know of this. Do you
mean to say that Mr. Mulhall was trying to conceal it from you, or
that you simply do not recollect it?

Mr. Emery. No; there is no question of recollection. I would
distinctly know—that is, I would know certainly—if I participated in
such a movement; and I ought to know if the association was par-
ticipating in such a movement.

enator REED. But Mr. Mulhall did write the association about it?
Mr. Emery. It is very evident.8934 MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION.

Senator Reep. He wrote to its secretary in regard to Judge Jenkins.
Did I correctly understand you to say that you made no effort to
raise money for Judge Jenkins ?

Mr. Emery. I, personally ?

Senator REep. Yes.

Mr. Emery. No. sir.

Senator Reep. That you did not further or father any effort to
raise money for him?

Mr Emery. I would not say that. I know that doubtless in
the course of conversation with—I can not recall names now, but I
know I entertained a strong opinion on the subject, that it was a
shame that the business men would not support a man like Judge
Jenkins

Senator Watsu. You told us the extent of that conversation you
had with Judge Jenkins, in which you stated to him that the manu-
facturers of the country were indebted to him for his position, and
that they ought to do something to help him in his district, and that
you believed they would. You told us that. “I think I have quoted
you with substantial accuracy. Is that correct?

Mr. Emery. Except for the latter part of your statement, in which
you attribute to me the offer of financial support. As I said, in the
conversation T had with Judge Jenkins T expressed to Judge Jenkins
a very strong opinion as to how I felt, but there was nothing in his
attitude or his manner or his speech that indicated any expectation
of financial help.”

Senator Watsu. I understand that. You told us that was the
extent of your connection with funds in the matter of rendering
assistance to Judge Jenkins.

Senator Reep. You told us that you repudiated that statement,
to Mr. Mulhall. I asked you if you ever wrote him and repudiated
that statement, and you said you did not; but you said that you met
peey New York and had a talk with him, and in that talk you repudi-
ated it.

Mr. Emery. I repudiated the speech described in that letter.

Senator Reep. And you also gave us to understand, did you not,
that you did not raise or try to raise any money for Judge Jenkins ?

Mr. Emery. No: personally, I did not.

Senator Reep. Ido not know what you mean by “personally,’’ but
: ask re if that is your signature to that letter. (Handing witness

etter.

Mr. Emery (after examination). Yes, sir.

Senator Reep. I ask that this be marked as an exhibit.

The letter referred to was marked Emery Exhibit No. 40.

Senator ReeEp. This is on the Citizens’ Industrial Association letter-
head, dated New York, July 7th, 1908, and addressed to Col. M. M.
Mulhall, Superior Hotel, Superior, Wis. That was in Judge Jenkins’s
district, was it not ¢

Mr. Emery. Yes, sir.

Senator Reep. This letter reads:

My Dear Cotonet: You no doubt have me on your black list for apparent neglect
of your very interesting and exhaustive letters. I found it necessary to attend a
southern convention at Atlanta. Ga., and left here on family matters immediately

on my return. I realize very keenly the critical nature of the Wisconsin situation
and I hope we have some lines out that will secure practical assistance within a fewMAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION. 89385

days. The extreme heat of the past week has apparently driven out of New York
every man whom we have been most anxious to see, which has prevented the work
T have been most anxious to do here in connection with the Jenkins decision.

That word evidently should be ‘‘election.”

I am attending after to-morrow a convention of the State Bankers’ Association at
which I expect to find some of the men I am most anxious to see.

I hope you will have an early interview with Senator Stevenson, who seems to
be the key of the Wisconsin situation financially. He has spent so much to put
himeelf where he is that it would be strange if he would not contribute a bit more to
sustain his present position and prevent the absolute dominance of Ia Follette of
Wisconsin, which would mean his elimination from public life and the bitter loss
of the fruits of his own generosity and trust in another. I trust I may have some-
thing concrete to say by the first of next week.

With best of good wishes, believe me,

Very truly yours, James A. EMERy,

Secretary.
J.A. ELM. W.

P. S.—I enclose a copy of a letter written by Mr. Miles to prominent ministers in
icone with whom he has influence and who, in their turn, are in a position to be

elpful.

The first thing I want to direct. your attention to, Mr. Emery, and
refresh your recollection as to, is this. The letter of Mr. Mulhall, with
reference to which you testified, being letter 1647-1649, and which is
referred to in the record at page 2791, is dated June 23, 1908. The
letter I have just read you is dated July 7, 1908, and apologizes for
not having answered Mr. Mulhall’s letters. Now, is not this letter of
July 7 an answer to that vory letter which you hold in your hand?

Mr. Emery. It may be, Senator.

Senator Reep. And is not this also true, that you are mistaken
when you say that you had an interview with Mr. Mulhall a few days
afterwards?) Can you not tell from this letter of July 7, addressed
to him at Superior, Wis., that he was still out in the district of Mr.
Jenkins ¢

Mr. Emery. It is very likely, Senator.

Senator Reep. So that it is very evident you were mistaken whon
you said you did not answer the letter of June 23, and you were evi-
dently mistaken about having had a conversation with Mr. Mulhall
in which you repudiated his letter of June 23, er repudiated this state-
ment in it that you have criticized ?

Mr. Exery. It is quite possible, Senator, that the interview was
later; looking back over the matter, five years ago. Of course I have
not seen any of my letters, or had any chance to refresh my recollection.

Senator Reep. I understand. J am not criticizing you; I am trying
to get the facts.

Mr. Emery. Yes, sir; and I am trying the best I can to give them
to you.

Senator REE. It appears from this letter of July 7, written some
10 days, or some 14 days, perhaps, after the letter of June 23, that
you not only did not repudiate his statement which you criticized
this morning, but that you were fully in accord with his letter, and
did start to raise money—tried to raise money.

Mr. Emery. It is very evident from that etter that some effort
was made, but I had no

Senator Reep. It is also evident that you made a personal effort,
is it not?.

Mr. Emery. You mean that I personally tried to raise money ?3936 MAINTENANCE OF A LOBBY TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION.

Senator ReEp. Yes.

Mr. Emery. I can only give you, in connection with the letter,
my very best recollection, which is that I made no special effort.
I may have talked to somebody about it in a general way, but I
can not recall anybody.

Senator Reep. I do not know what you mean by “special effort.’’
Just let me read the letter again, to refresh your recollection. I
realize that a busy man, with thousands of things on his hands, has
to go somewhat by memoranda and records. I have had to do it.
I am calling your attention to the language of this letter:

I realize very keenly the critical nature of the Wisconsin situation—

That referred to Mr. Mulhall’s letter where he told you that it was
going to be a hard fight?

Mr. Emery. Yes, sir.

Senator Reep. And this letter goes on:
and I hope we have some lines out that will secure practical assistance within
few days.

Now, whom did you mean by that?

Mr. Emery. I suppose I referred to a number of my associates or
officers. As I told you, Senator

Senator Reep. You must have had a talk with them about it,
then

Mr. Emery. Yes. As I told you——

Senator Reep (continuing). And arranged to get the lines out.
That much had been done, and you had been personally concerned
in it to the extent of talking it over with other members, or with
some of the other officers of the association. That is correct, is it not?

Mr. Emery. Yes sir.

Senator Reep. Now, I continue with this letter. The practical
assistance, of course, that you expected to get, was money. That is
what your were writing about ?

Mr. Emery. Yes sir.

Senator Reep. The letter continues:

The extreme heat of the past week has apparently driven out of New York every
man whom we have been most anxious to see—

Those were the capitalists, the manufacturers, the men who had
money, that you referred to, were they not? I will read it again:

The extreme heat of the past week has apparently driven out of New York every
man whom we have been most anxious to see, which has prevented the work I have
been most anxious to do here in connection with the Jenkins decision.

The word ‘decision’ should evidently be “election.” The
stenographer probably made a mistake. That referred to people you
had expected to see, did it not?

Mr. Emery. Very evidently, yes sir.

Senator Reep. Now, going a little further:

I am attending after to-morrow a convention of the State Bankers’ Association—

That was the State Bankers’ Association of New York, was ‘t not?
Mr. Emery. Yes sir.
Senator Reep. I will read on:
at which I expect to find some of the men I am most anxious to see.
You did attend that bankers’ association meeting, did you?
Mr. Emery. Yes.
